Prefer self-documenting code over comments. Add comments only when they add context that isn't already clear from the code itself.

Suggest tests where there isn't coverage.

Suggest removing duplication where it could be extracted.

This project uses yarn as the package manager, not npm. Always use yarn commands (yarn start, yarn build, yarn install, etc.).
